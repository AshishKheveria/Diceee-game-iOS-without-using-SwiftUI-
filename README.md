## Goal

The user taps on the roll button and the two DICES rolls and shows the random numbers.

## What we will create

We’re going to make a Las Vegas dice app. We can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking the phone. With this app in our pocket, we’ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!


## What we will be using

* Using randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.
